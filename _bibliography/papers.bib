	abstract = {The migration of Twitter users to Mastodon following Elon Musk's acquisition presents a unique opportunity to study collective behavior and gain insights into the drivers of coordinated behavior in online media. We analyzed the social network and the public conversations of about 75,000 migrated users and observed that the temporal trace of their migrations is compatible with a phenomenon of social influence, as described by a compartmental epidemic model of information diffusion. Drawing from prior research on behavioral change, we delved into the factors that account for variations of the effectiveness of the influence process across different Twitter communities. Communities in which the influence process unfolded more rapidly exhibit lower density of social connections, higher levels of signaled commitment to migrating, and more emphasis on shared identity and exchange of factual knowledge in the community discussion. These factors account collectively for 57{\%} of the variance in the observed data. Our results highlight the joint importance of network structure, commitment, and psycho-linguistic aspects of social interactions in characterizing grassroots collective action, and contribute to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms that drive processes of behavior change of online groups.},

abstract = {Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have emerged as the most representative application of blockchain technology in recent years, fostering the development of the Web3. Nonetheless, while the interest in NFTs rapidly boomed, creating unprecedented fervour in traders and creators, the demand for highly representative and up-to-date data to shed light on such an intriguing yet complex domain mostly remained unmet. To pursue this objective, we introduce a large collection of NFT transactions and associated metadata that correspond to trading operations between 2021 and 2023. Our developed dataset is the most extensive and representative in the NFT landscape to date, as it contains more than 70 M transactions performed by more than 6 M users across 36.3 M NFTs and 281 K collections. Moreover, this dataset boasts a wealth of metadata, including encoded textual descriptions and multimedia content, thus being suitable for a plethora of tasks relevant to database systems, AI, data science, Web and network science fields. This dataset represents a unique resource for researchers and industry practitioners to delve into the inner workings of NFTs through a multitude of perspectives, paving the way for unprecedented opportunities across multiple research fields.},

abstract = {Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) represent deeds of ownership, based on blockchain technologies and smart contracts, of unique crypto assets on digital art forms (e.g., artworks or collectibles). In the spotlight after skyrocketing in 2021, NFTs have attracted the attention of crypto enthusiasts and investors intent on placing promising investments in this profitable market. However, the NFT financial performance prediction has not been widely explored to date. In this work, we address the above problem based on the hypothesis that NFT images and their textual descriptions are essential proxies to predict the NFT selling prices. To this purpose, we propose MERLIN, a novel multimodal deep learning framework designed to train Transformer-based language and visual models, along with graph neural network models, on collections of NFTs’ images and texts. A key aspect in MERLIN is its independence on financial features, as it exploits only the primary data a user interested in NFT trading would like to deal with, i.e., NFT images and textual descriptions. By learning dense representations of such data, a price-category classification task is performed by MERLIN models, which can also be tuned according to user preferences in the inference phase to mimic different risk-return investment profiles. Experimental evaluation on a publicly available dataset has shown that MERLIN models achieve significant performances according to several financial assessment criteria, fostering profitable investments, and also beating baseline machine-learning classifiers based on financial features.},

abstract="The study of fairness-related aspects in data analysis is an active field of research, which can be leveraged to understand and control specific types of bias in decision-making systems. A major problem in this context is fair clustering, i.e., grouping data objects that are similar according to a common feature space, while avoiding biasing the clusters against or towards particular types of classes or sensitive features. In this work, we focus on a correlation-clustering method we recently introduced, and experimentally assess its performance in a fairness-aware context. We compare it to state-of-the-art fair-clustering approaches, both in terms of classic clustering quality measures and fairness-related aspects. Experimental evidence on public real datasets has shown that our method yields solutions of higher quality than the competing methods according to classic clustering-validation criteria, without neglecting fairness aspects.",

  abstract = {Decentralized Online Social Networks (DOSNs) represent a growing trend in the social media landscape, as opposed to the well-known centralized peers, which are often in the spotlight due to privacy concerns and a vision typically focused on monetization through user relationships. By exploiting open-source software, DOSNs allow users to create their own servers, or instances, thus favoring the proliferation of platforms that are independent yet interconnected with each other in a transparent way. Nonetheless, the resulting cooperation model, commonly known as the Fediverse, still represents a world to be fully discovered, since existing studies have mainly focused on a limited number of structural aspects of interest in DOSNs. In this work, we aim to fill a lack of study on user relations and roles in DOSNs, by taking two main actions: understanding the impact of decentralization on how users relate to each other within their membership instance and/or across different instances, and unveiling user roles that can explain two interrelated axes of social behavioral phenomena, namely information consumption and boundary spanning. To this purpose, we build our analysis on user networks from Mastodon, since it represents the most widely used DOSN platform. We believe that the findings drawn from our study on Mastodon users’ roles and information flow can pave a way for further development of fascinating research on DOSNs.},

In this work, we push forward research on user behaviors in a decentralized context, by exploring the dichotomy between information consumption and production. Using the Mastodon user network as a proxy for the Fediverse landscape, we address two main research questions: Do the consumers, resp. producers, identified in one instance exhibit the same behavior consistently while interacting with other instances? and, Are there users who behave as consumers in one instance and simultaneously as producers in other instances, or vice versa? In this respect, our results reveal interesting traits of Mastodon users, yet unveil the emergence for further studies that can embrace other services in the Fediverse.},

	abstract = {Open-source, Decentralized Online Social Networks (DOSNs) are emerging as alternatives to the popular yet centralized and profit-driven platforms like Facebook or Twitter. In DOSNs, users can set up their own server, or instance, while they can actually interact with users of other instances. Moreover, by adopting the same communication protocol, DOSNs become part of a massive social network, namely the Fediverse. Mastodon is the most relevant platform in the Fediverse to date, and also the one that has attracted attention from the research community. Existing studies are however limited to an analysis of a relatively outdated sample of Mastodon focusing on few aspects at a user level, while several open questions have not been answered yet, especially at the instance level. In this work, we aim at pushing forward our understanding of the Fediverse by leveraging the primary role of Mastodon therein. Our first contribution is the building of an up-to-date and highly representative dataset of Mastodon. Upon this new data, we have defined a network model over Mastodon instances and exploited it to investigate three major aspects: the structural features of the Mastodon network of instances from a macroscopic as well as a mesoscopic perspective, to unveil the distinguishing traits of the underlying federative mechanism; the backbone of the network, to discover the essential interrelations between the instances; and the growth of Mastodon, to understand how the shape of the instance network has evolved during the last few years, also when broading the scope to account for instances belonging to other platforms. Our extensive analysis of the above aspects has provided a number of findings that reveal distinguishing features of Mastodon and that can be used as a starting point for the discovery of all the DOSN Fediverse.},
