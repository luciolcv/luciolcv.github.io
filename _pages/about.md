I'm a Ph.D. Student in Information and Communication Technologies at the [Department of Computer Engineering, Modeling, Electronics, and Systems Engineering (DIMES)](http://www.dimes.unical.it/) of the [University of Calabria](https://unical.it/), Italy. 

I graduated magna cum laude in Computer Engineering in 2020 at the University of Calabria. I was visiting student at the IT University of Copenhagen from January to April 2023, working in the [NEtwoRks, Data, and Society (NERDS) group](https://nerds.itu.dk/). I am a member of the [Machine Learning, NLP and Network Science Team](https://mlnteam-unical.github.io/) @Artificial Intelligence and Data Science Lab at DIMES.

I'm interested in Multimodal Representation Learning (including Graph Representation Learning, NLP, Computer Vision) and Network Science for the Study of Emerging Decentralized Socio-Economic Systems. My main focus is on Decentralized Online Social Networks (DOSNs) and the Web3 ecosystem.
